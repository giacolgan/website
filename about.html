			I'm from West Chester, PA, but I think of the Bay Area as a second home. 
			<br><br> I like using data to solve problems, tell stories, and uncover (and then answer!) complex and important questions. I'm currently applying this curiosity as a Senior BI Analyst at <a style = "color:#FCA311"; href = "https://www.get-carrot.com/"> Carrot Fertility</a>. Previously, I worked as an Analyst at <a style = "color:#FCA311"; href = "https://www.sonder.com/"> Sonder</a>, a startup in the hospitality/travel space. Before that, I was at Stanford, where I received a B.A. in Public Health with a concentration in Social Determinants of Health.
			<br><br> I'm passionate about health equity, sustainability, and data justice.
			<br><br> When I'm not working, I'm usually reading, mountain biking, hiking, or cooking.
